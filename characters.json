    "name": "Duke Gruesome",
    "profession": "Childcare Professional",
    "idol": "Tony Robbins",
    "weapon": "Charm",
    "bio": "Born to a family of professional wrestlers, it seemed that Duke Gruesome's life was set. He was talented, charming, and had the shoulder girth of John Cena. But much like John Cena, Duke Gruesome's own dreams were unseeable. He didn't want to crush big bodies, he wanted to build little bodies and minds through care and the thoughtful all-inclusive education process. He founded Gruesome Care soon after graduating from the exclusive University of Phoenix Childcare program and has never looked back. When he's not bench pressing toddlers, he can be found teaching his weekly doggie painting classes, which aim to teach every paw to paint.",
